# ETL project analyzing The Office 🐍
Hi! Thanks for visiting my repository 😃 In this Data Analysis with Python course, made by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, I have learned the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. The course covered everything from cleaning and preprocessing data to using libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scipy in order to process, visualize and make predictions using the available data.

I also had the opportunity to work on hands-on projects that allowed me to apply what I learned and build my skills in a practical setting. Although you can find out what each one is about if you access them individually, here is a brief summary of each one of them:

### Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator ➗
Function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

### Demographic Data Analyzer 📊
Analysis of demographic data using Pandas. The dataset contains demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database.

### Medical Data Visualizer 🚑
Visualization and calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

### Page View Time Series Visualizer 📈
Visualization of time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots (made with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn). The dataset contains the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.

### Sea Level Predictor 🌊
Analysis of a dataset containing the global average sea level change since 1880, using the Scipy library to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
