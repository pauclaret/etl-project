# The Office Data Analysis 💼📊🚀
Welcome to my repository! I am motivated to share with you the results of my data analysis project on The Office, a beloved American sitcom. From the beginning, I was determined to uncover insights about the show using a variety of tools and techniques to extract, clean, and analyze data.

The main objective of this project was to extract, clean, and analyze data from various sources in order to gain a deeper understanding of the show and its characters. I aimed to answer questions such as: Which episodes were the most popular? Who are the most beloved characters? And what can we learn about the show's audience?

## Navigating through the repository folders:

### Data 📥
I began by extracting data from different sources using Selenium and an API, and then I cleaned and preprocessed the data using Jupyter. The extracted data contains information about the episodes and characters of The Office.

### Notebook 📝
From there, I created an SQL database and used SQLAlchemy to insert the data into the database. I also used SQLAlchemy to perform various queries on the data in Jupyter, which I then used to create visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations allowed me to uncover insights about the show, such as the most popular episodes and characters.

### Images 🖼️
In this folder, you will find the visualizations created using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These images will help you understand the insights and conclusions I obtained from the data.

### Support 🔧
This folder contains the Python support documentation, which will help you understand how the code works and how to use it.

### Database 🗄️
This folder contains the SQL script used to create the database, as well as the SQL queries used to insert and extract data from the database.

### Libraries 📚
Here are some of the libraries I used in this project:
- pandas: a library that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.
- sqlalchemy: a library that provides a nice API to interact with SQL databases.
- numpy: a library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numerical data.
- matplotlib: a library that provides functions for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- seaborn: a library that is built on top of matplotlib and provides a more powerful API for creating visualizations.
- selenium: a library that allows you to automate web browsers and interact with web pages programmatically.
- requests: a library that allows you to send HTTP requests in Python and handle the response.


I hope you enjoy exploring the project as much as I enjoyed creating it. And remember, "That's what she said."
